### Hello! 🍔  
My name is Austin Moses, and welcome to my **Food App**!

This app showcases my **favorite foods**, their **ratings**, and a collection of my **favorite recipes**. It's a fun way to explore the foods I love and how I rate them, along with some tasty recipes to try out!

### 🚀 Technology Stack:
- **Development**: VSCode
- **Deployment**: Render
- **Database**: MongoDB

With this app, I wanted to combine my love for food with development skills, creating something that's not only useful but also enjoyable for anyone interested in food ratings and recipes.  

I hope you enjoy exploring the app as much as I enjoyed building it!

Feel free to check out the code, and explore the delicious world of food!
